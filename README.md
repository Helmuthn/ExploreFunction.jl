This library is developed as part of a course project for ECE 557, Geometric Control Theory, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

The goal of this project is to develop a technique for generating a graphical model representing how local minima of a function are connected, where a connection is defined as sharing a boundary of their respective stable sub-manifolds.
